In this experiment, we will see a fundamental problem related to graphs, Graph Traversal. It is nothing more than
visiting every vertex of the given graph. Based on the order in which we visit the vertices, we define two different
types of graph traversals. The order of vertices thus obtained can be useful in understanding several properties of the graph.
<br /><br />

Two main techniques : Breadth First Search (BFS), and Depth First Search (DFS).

<h3>Breadth First Search (BFS)</h3>
BFS is similar to level order traversal in a tree, where we visit vertices in a level by level order. We specify a starting vertex <i>S</i>
and start visiting vertices of the graph <i>G</i> from the vertex <i>S</i>. As a general graph can have cycles, we may visit the same vertex more than once. To solve this,
we also maintain the state of each vertex. A vertex can be in one of three states, VISITED, NOT_VISITED, IN_PROCESS.
The basic idea of breadth first search is to find the least number of edges between <i>S</i> and any other vertex in <i>G</i>. Starting from 
<i>S</i>, we visit vertices of distance <i>k</i> before visiting any vertex of distance <i>k+1</i>. For that purpose, 
define <i>ds(v)</i> to be the least number of edges between <i>S</i> and <i>v</i> in <i>G</i>. So, for vertices <i>v</i> that are not reachable from 
<i>S</i> we can have <i>ds(v)</i> = &infin;. We can use a queue to store vertices in progress.

<p>
We also a maintain <i>from[u]</i> for each of the vertex <i>u</i>, which denotes the vertex that discovered <i>u</i>. This information
can be used to define the predecessor subgraph of <i>G</i>, which has all edges <i>(from[u],u)</i>. These edges are called as
tree edges. For a tree edge <i>(u, v), ds(v) = ds(u) + 1</i>. All other edges are called non-tree edges and are further classified 
as back edges and cross edges. A non-tree edge (u, v) is called as a back edge if <i>ds(v) &lt; ds(u)</i>, meaning <i>u</i> can be 
reached from <i>S</i> via <i>v</i>, but there is yet another shortest path through path <i>u</i> can be reached from <i>S</i>.
An edge <i>(u, v) </i> is called a cross edge if d(v) &le; d(u) + 1.


</p>

<p>
<i>
<b>Procedure BFS(G)</b> <br/>
&nbsp;for each v in V(G) do<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	from[v] = NIL; state[v] = NOT_VISITED; d(v) = &infin;<br/>
&nbsp;end-for<br/><br/>

&nbsp;ds[S] = 0; state[S] = IN_PROCESS; from[s] = NIL;<br/>
&nbsp;Q = EMPTY; Q.Enqueue(S);<br/><br/>

&nbsp;While Q is not empty do<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	v = Q.Dequeue();<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	for each neighbour w of v do<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		if state[w] == NOT_VISITED then<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;			state[w] = IN_PROCESS; from[w] = v; ds[w] = ds[v] + 1; Q.Enqueue(w);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		end-if<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;		state[v] = VISITED<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	end-for<br/>
&nbsp;end-while<br/>
<b>End-BFS</b> <br/>
</i>
</p>


<i><u>Runtime:</u></i> Each vertex enters the queue at most once and each edge is considered only once. Therefore, runtime of BFS is <i>O(m+n)</i>, 
where <i>n</i> is the number of vertices and <i>m</i> is the number of edges in <i>G</i>.


<br/><br/>

<h3>Depth First Search (DFS)</h3>

The idea of DFS is to start from a specified start vertex <i>S</i> and explore from <i>S</i> as deep as possible.
We go from <i>S</i>, to one of its neighbors <i>x</i>, to a neighbor of <i>x</i>, and so on. We stop when there are no new 
neighbors to explore from a given vertex. If all vertices are not visited, pick another start vertex from such vertices.
We have to keep track of the state of a vertex and similar to BFS, a vertex can be in three states: VISITED, NOT_VISITED, IN_PROCESS.
We also a maintain <i>from[u], d[u], f[u]</i> for each of the vertex <i>u</i>, which denotes the vertex that discovered <i>u</i>,
the discovery time of <i>u</i> and the finish time <i>u</i>. 


<p>
<i>
<b>Procedure Explore(v)</b><br/>
&nbsp; d[v] = cur_time;<br/>
&nbsp; cur_time = cur_time + 1;<br/>
&nbsp;     for each neighbor w of v <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;          if state(w) == NOT_VISITED then<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            state(w) = IN_PROCESS;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             Explore(w);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;           end-if<br/>
&nbsp;       end-for<br/>
&nbsp;       state(v) = VISITED;<br/>
&nbsp; f[v] = cur_time;<br/>
&nbsp; cur_time = cur_time + 1;<br/>
<b>End-Explore</b><br/>

<br/>

<b>Procedure DFS(G)</b><br/>
&nbsp;	cur_time = 0<br/>
&nbsp;	for v = 1 to n do<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;           if state(v) == NOT_VISITED then<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                state(v) = IN_PROCESS;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               Explore(v);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;            end-if<br/>
&nbsp;	end-for<br/>
<b>End-DFS</b><br/>

</p>

<i><u>Runtime:</u></i> Explore() is called for each vertex exactly once and each edge is considered only once. Therefore, runtime of 
DFS is <i>O(m+n)</i>, where <i>n</i> is the number of vertices and <i>m</i> is the number of edges in <i>G</i>.

<br/><br/>

<p>
Classification of edges, based on Depth First traversal is as follows

<ul>

<li><u>Tree Edges</u> : All edges <i>(from[u],u)</i> are called as tree edges and define a dfs tree, a subgraph of <i>G</i>. 
<ul><li><i>An edge (u,v)</i> is a tree edge if <i>from[v] = u</i></li></ul>
</li>

<br/>

<li><u>Back Edges</u> : A non-tree edge <i>(u, v)</i> is called as a back edge if <i>v</i> is an ancestor of <i>u</i> in the dfs tree.
<i>u</i> can be reached from <i>v</i> using tree edges, but there an edge from <i>u</i> to <i>v</i> also.
<ul><li><i>An edge (u,v)</i> is a back edge if [d(u), f(u)]  is a subinterval of [d(v), f(v)]</li></ul>
</li>

<br/>

<li><u>Forward Edges</u> : A non-tree edge <i>(u, v)</i> is called as a forward edge if <i>v</i> is a descendant of <i>u</i> in the 
dfs tree. <i>v</i> can be reached from <i>u</i> using tree edges, but there an edge from <i>u</i> to <i>v</i> also.
<ul><li><i>An edge (u,v)</i> is a forward edge if [d(v), f(v)] is a subinterval of [d(u), f(u)].</li></ul>
</li>

<br/>

<li><u>Cross Edges</u> : Non-tree edges <i>(u, v)</i> where <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> do not share any ancestor/descendant relationship 
are called cross edges.
<ul><li><i>An edge (u,v)</i> is a cross edge if the two intervals [d(u), f(u)] and [d(v), f(v)] do not overlap.</li></ul>
</li>

</ul>

finish time of v?
</li>
<li> Consider a directed graph G with an edge (u,v). Suppose that there
is no path from v to u in G. Is it true that the finish time of u is
always larger than the finish time of v?
</li>
<li> Consider the setting of the above question. Suppose now that C and
C' are two subsets of vertices so that there is a path between every
vertex in C (C') to every other vertex in C (C'), and there is an edge
(u,v) with u in C and v in C'. Suppose also that there is no path from
any vertex in C' to any vertex in C. Is it true that any vertex in C has
a finish time larger than any vertex in C'? Justify your answer.
</li>

<li> Let G be an undirected graph and we apply BFS on G. Classify the
edges of G as tree edges, back edges, forward edges, and cross edges.
Are any of these classes empty? If so, why?
</li>

<li> Let G be an undirected graph. Use DFS on G to partition the vertices 
of G into subsets V1, V2, ..., so that two vertices u and v are in the 
same partition if and only if there is a path between u to v. Such
subsets are called as the connected components of G.
</li>

<li> Let G have k connected components. How would k change if one edge
is added to G? How would k change if one edge is removed from G.

<li>
Consider the problem of arranging the vertices of a directed acyclic
graph so that if (u,v) is an edge in the graph then $u$
appears before $v$ in the arragenment. Such an arrangement is called
as a topological sorting of the graph. Design an algorithm using DFS to
obtain a topological sort of a given directed acyclic graph. What is the
runtime of your algorithm.

<li> Repeat the above question with using BFS instead of DFS. Is there
any difference in the runtime? Which approach do you prefer and why?
