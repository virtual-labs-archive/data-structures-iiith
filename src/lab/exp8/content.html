In this experiment, we look at the weighted version of Breadth First Search(BFS). In BFS, we have measured <i>ds(v)</i> in terms of 
number of edges in the path from the starting vertex <i>s</i> to <i>v</i>. This is equivalent to assuming that each edge in the graph 
has equal (unit) weight.
Here we consider a more general setting, where we are given a weighted graph <i>G = (V, E, W)</i> with a weight function <i>W : E &ndash;&gt; R</i>.
A typical example is Road networks, where junctions can be treated as vertices and roads as edges with distance as its corresponding 
weights. A typical problem is to find the shortest distance between two junctions <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>, where the distance is the 
sum of weights of edges along a <i>u</i> --- <i>v</i> path.

<h3>Bellman-Ford</h3>
Lets look at a simple method, by extending the approach used in BFS. We define <i>ds(v)</i> as the minimum cost of a path from
<i>s</i> to <i>v</i>. Initially <i>ds(v) = &infin;</i> for all vertices <i>v</i> except <i>s</i>, and <i>ds(s) = 0</i>. Recall that in BFS,
 we say a node is finished if it is in the queue. If we directly enqueue all the neighbors <i>v</i> of a vertex <i>u</i> in to the 
 queue and mark them as finished, it may not work for this weighted version. There can be another path from <i>u</i> to <i>v</i>

 with more number of edges but with smaller cost. So, we may have to change <i>ds(v)</i> while <i>v</i> is still in queue. If you
 consider the same argument using paths with more edges but with smaller cost, even this may not work. We may need to update
 <i>ds(v)</i> even when <i>v</i> is not in queue and can do so as long as there are changes to some <i>ds(v)</i>. This suggests that we
 need not have a queue and as there are only a finite number of edges in any shortest path, the updations will stop eventually. This is the
 Bellman-Ford single source shortest path algorithm and is descibed below.
 
<p>

<i>
<b>Algorithm Bellman-Ford(G,S)</b> <br>
&nbsp;for all vertices v do <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ds(v) = &infin;; from(v) = NIL;<br>
&nbsp;end-for<br>
&nbsp;for n-1 iterations do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for each edge (v,w) do <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ds(w) &gt; ds(v) + W(v,w) then<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ds(w) = ds(v) + W(v,w); from(w) = v;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end-if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end-for<br>
&nbsp;end-for<br>
<b>End-Bellman-Ford</b><br>
</i>
</p>

<p> 
The algorithm requires <i>O(mn)</i> time, where <i>n</i> is the number of vertices and <i>m</i> is the number of edges.
For each of the <i>n</i>-1 iterations, we consider each edge once.


<br><br>

<h3>Dijkstra</h3>

The time taken by the Bellman-Ford algorithm is too high because of repeatedly considering edges and updating <i>ds(v)</i> 
possibly many times. We need to know when to stop updating <i>ds(v)</i> for a vertex <i>v</i> and we will now see a method
which captures this and improves the runtime. A vertex <i>v</i> is done, when no further shorter path can be found to it 
from <i>s</i> i.e., when <i>ds(v)</i> can no longer decrease. We consider a few vertices, say <i>S</i>, are done. A vertex with 
the smallest <i>ds</i> value among the vertices in <i>V(G) \ S</i> can no longer improve its <i>ds</i> value. This is because, 
any more change would involved using at least one more additional edge. This suggests that the vertex with the smallest <i>ds</i> value
 can be moved to the set <i>S</i>. Initially, only the starting vertex <i>s</i> is in the set <i>S</i> and we incrementally
 populate <i>S</i> with more vertices.
We can proceed iteratively and in each iteration, move a vertex with the least <i>ds</i> value to set <i>S</i>. When we move a 
vertex <i>v</i> to <i>S</i>, the neighbors of <i>v</i> may find a better path from <i>s</i>, so we have to update <i>ds(w)</i> for 
neighbors <i>w</i> of <i>v</i>, if necessary.

The only steps left to take care is, finding a vertex in <i>V(G) \ S</i> that has the least <i>ds</i> value. Also, we have to update the

<i>ds</i> values of vertices in <i>V(G) \ S</i> if needed. This is very similar to Prims algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree, 
except that the costs <i>ds</i> are added with the edge weights for updation.
We can use a Binary Heap here. This is the Dijkstras single source shortest path algorithm and is described below.

<p>
<i>
<b>Algorithm Dijkstra(G,s)</b> <br>
&nbsp;for all vertices v do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ds(v) = infin;; from(v) = NIL;<br>

&nbsp;end-for<br>
&nbsp;ds(s) = 0;<br>
&nbsp;S = &Phi;<br>
&nbsp;for n iterations do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v = the vertex with the least ds() value among V \ S;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add v to S<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for each neighbor w of v in V \ S do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d(w) = min { d(w), d(v) + W(v,w) }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end-for<br>

&nbsp;end-for<br>
<b>End-Dijkstra</b><br>
</i>
</p>

<p>
We will analyze the algorithm when using a binary heap. A binary heap is built out of the n nodesa and there are <i>n</i> 
DeleteMin() operations and at most <i>m</i> DecreaseKey() operations. Each DeleteMin() takes <i>O(log n)</i> time and each
 DecreaseKey() operation takes <i>O(log n)</i> time. So, the total time is <i>O((n+m)log n)</i>.

<li> Consider an example graph of 10 vertices and 15 edges. Pick a
source vertex s, and using Dijkstra's algorithm find the shortest path
from s to all other vertices.
</li>

<li> Dijkstra's algorithm requires that no edge weight is negative. Why
is this restriction required? At what place does the algorithm fail if
this restriction is removed? Can you create an example graph with one
edge of negative weight where Dijkstra's algorithm fails?
</li>

<li> Suppose that the edge weights in a graph are all either 1 or 2. Can
you modify Dijkstra's algorithm to run faster? If so, describe your
approach and analyze the runtime of your approach.
</li>

<li> Generalize the above question where the edge weights are between

</li>

<li> Is it ture that in any graph there exists an ordering of the
vertices as v1, v2, ..., vn, so that when relaxing the edges with one
end point being vi in the ith iteration, shortest paths from v1 to all
other vertices can be found in a total time of O(m+n)? If so, how can
one find such an ordering? You can assume that the graph has no edges of
negative weight.

<li> Consider the setting of the above question. How does Dijkstra's
